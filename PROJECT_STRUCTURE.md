data/: This folder contains the data layer of the app, including models that define the data structures, repositories that handle the data sources, providers that manage state, services that handle network requests or other external interactions, and utility functions that help with data manipulation or formatting.

presentation/: This folder contains the UI layer of the app, including screens that define the top-level UI components, widgets that define reusable UI elements, pages that define specific UI flows or sequences, navigation that handles app routing, and themes that define app-wide styling.

domain/: This folder contains the domain layer of the app, including entities that represent the business logic of the app and use cases that define specific actions or interactions within the app.

app.dart: This file defines the top-level App widget and sets up any global dependencies or configurations.

main.dart: This file is the entry point of the app and sets up the initial UI and any required services or providers.

The Data layer is responsible for providing access to data from external sources such as databases, web services, and other repositories. It abstracts the source of the data and provides a way for the Domain layer to retrieve and manipulate it.

The Domain layer is responsible for encapsulating the business logic of the application. It contains the rules and processes that govern the application's behavior and ensures that the application's data is consistent and valid. The Domain layer is where the majority of the application's value resides.
